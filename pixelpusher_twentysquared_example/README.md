# PixelPusher TwentySquared Example

An example to make it easy to program PixelPusher TwentySquared LED Tiles.  This example shows a perlin noise buffer being sent to all attached tiles.

Images are drawn to the `PImage` instance `tileBuffer`, and the tile's pixels are set using the `setTile(PGraphics img, Strip tile)` on an image and a tile to send the image to the tile.  See the `pixelpusher_twentysquared_pgraphics` example for how to send vector images to the TwentySquared.
